<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My nickname is Abohisham i'm a .. year old student who goes in a highschool in ... 
    I like coding and building some hardware in my spare time. Therefore i chose to make this website
    where i can add my coding projects and hardware projects i make in my free time, but also
    a place for my school notes, so i have everything i need in one place. I hope this will turn out good,
    and in the future i'm planning to make it accessible for other people so they can add whatever they want,
    all in one place.
