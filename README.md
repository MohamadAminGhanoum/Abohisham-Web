# Abohisham-Web

In this website there is everything that you will need for school notes, programming projects and hardware projects
I want to have good looking ui and i will try to make it work so i later can maybe buy a domain, obtain a server, make a database and develop it into a better webpage that other people can register into and add do whatever they want with it.

Note: I will in the future update this to make it suit for everyone, instead of letting it be “Abohisham-web”.
But as a start, it is a more personal website with notes and projects.

Here is a picture of the front page:

You can try the website out and test it using the following link: https://mohamadaminghanoum.github.io/Abohisham-Web/index.html

I have focused in this project on simplisity and ui, so it is peaceful to use everyday. I wanted to make this project to have everything that i need in my everyday life all in one place, instead of using e.g Onenote, google calendar, notepad and to-dolist app. Im aiming in the future to make this accessiple for more people, and will also try to develop a mobile app, so the website can be accessible anywhere. 
The website saves the data locally, and i believe it would be a lot better if i could make a database to save the data, so they do not disappear. But since this is only the beginning, im focusing on making it functional, and then develop even more the backend in the future.

Making this website, i faced difficulties and had to use some help, therefor i followed som W3schools tutorials and had to learn how to save data locally by watching a yt video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMt3U1zfoe0. I also visited multiple websites to be inspired by layout. For AI, honestly i got stuck in a problem that i couldnt fix, therefore i had to ask AI to show me where the error was. But i have not done any copy-paste.
